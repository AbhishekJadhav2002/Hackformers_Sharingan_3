# Project Buddy

Collaborate, Connect, Create


ProjectBuddy is a web-based platform that connects users with potential team members based on their skills, experience, and interests. It incorporates several features that are commonly found in web development projects, such as user authentication, data storage and retrieval, and responsive design.


The ML component of ProjectBuddy involves analyzing user data and using this information to generate accurate and relevant recommendations. The algorithms used in ProjectBuddy are designed to continually improve and evolve over time, based on feedback from users. This means that the ML component of the application is constantly learning and adapting, providing users with more targeted and accurate recommendations.

The integration of ML technology in ProjectBuddy helps users to overcome the challenges of team-building and collaboration by streamlining the process of finding compatible team members.

The platform utilizes a backend system to handle user requests and to store and retrieve data from a database. It also incorporates machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and make recommendations for potential team members or matches. This integration of machine learning into the backend of the application highlights the significance of data science and AI in modern web development projects.

In the frontend, ProjectBuddy utilizes a modern web development stack with a focus on state management and responsive design. The platform uses state management techniques such as Redux and React Context API to efficiently manage the application's data and ensure a seamless user experience.
